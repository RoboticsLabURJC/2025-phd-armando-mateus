      <h2>Week 9 - Enhanced CARLA Performance and D.A.G.G.E.R. Dataset Implementation</h2>
      <p class="date">November 25, 2025</p>
      <p><strong>Improved simulation stability and advanced dataset aggregation for robust autonomous driving</strong></p>

      <p>This week marks significant progress in both technical performance with the CARLA simulator and the implementation of the D.A.G.G.E.R. (Dataset Aggregation) methodology for training data generation.</p>

      <p>We have successfully improved our technical workflow with CARLA, achieving stable driving sessions in Towns 01, 02, and 04 without crashes, while utilizing "Epic" quality settings for high-definition image capture. This enhancement significantly increases visual detail and consequently introduces greater variability into our training data. Using this improved setup, we generated a comprehensive dataset comprising 178,000 images representing key lane-following maneuvers: forward driving and lane recovery from the left lane back to the right lane.</p>

      <p>However, during autonomous driving tests, we observed a critical limitation: the vehicle demonstrates uncertainty when approaching the right side of multi-lane roads, particularly evident in Town 04. This issue frequently manifests when encountering right-turn lanes and dividers. This observation raises an important question: Could the driving style (aggressive versus defensive) of the human expert provide better response velocities in these challenging scenarios?</p>

      <p>Our second major task involved preparing a specialized dataset using the D.A.G.G.E.R. methodology. We implemented an approach that generates controlled steering perturbations through pulse bursts, modifying the vehicle's steering according to the following equation:</p>

      <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">steering = raw_steering × (1 - δ(t-τ)) + 0.5 × δ(t-τ)</p>

      <p>In this implementation, the delta function δ(t-τ) corresponds to pulses of variable duration between 0.5 and 1.0 seconds. The term 0.5 × δ(t-τ) initially limits steering modifications to two discrete values: +0.5 and -0.5.</p>

      <p>The construction of this dataset has proven particularly challenging due to the inherent randomness that can force the vehicle into frontal collisions with obstacles. This necessitates the development of a more systematic methodology for perturbation application to ensure meaningful training examples while maintaining vehicle safety during data collection.</p>
