      <h2>Week 1 </h2>
      <p class="date">30/09/2025</p>
      <p>
        Second week on my initial schedule for studying autonomous vehicles!
      </p>
      <p>Last week I've got CARLA 0.915 installed and ready to work thanks to the official Docker Image. However, it was not possible the integration to ROS2 via ROS2BRIDGE due to additional Docker requirements (someday I'll try that workflow). Instead, I've tried the method published on <a href=https://github.com/asujaykk/Self-Driving-Car-CARLA-ROS2?tab=readme-ov-file> https://github.com/asujaykk/...</a> and it was fine and smooth. Now, I can start an autopilot for a CARLA ego car from ROS2.</p>
      <p>I've also complete the study of the work of Sergio Paniego (End-to-end Vision-based Autonomous Driving using Deep Learning - PhD thesis); monitoring, metrics and an exploratory work on models for end-to-end autonomous driving are the core of the advances. 
      <p>Finally, a complementation of concepts and available tools for research on autonomous vehicles is performed by studying the work "Seguimiento de carril por visión y conducción autónoma con Aprendizaje por Imitación" (Vision-based Lane Keeping and Autonomous Driving using Imitation Learning) by Alejandro Moncalvillo González.
